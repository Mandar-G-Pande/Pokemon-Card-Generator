🚀 JavaScript Series - Part 2: Dynamic Pokémon Card Generator! 🎴⚡

Exploring APIs with JavaScript! This project fetches random Pokémon data from the PokéAPI and dynamically generates a styled Pokémon card. 🌟

🔹 Fetch API for data retrieval
🔹 Random Pokémon generation
🔹 Dynamic DOM manipulation
🔹 Custom theme colors based on Pokémon type

Stay tuned for more JavaScript projects! 💡 

In this project, I integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the PokéAPI to dynamically generate Pokémon cards. Each card displays a Pokémon’s name, image, HP, attack, defense, speed, and type, with a unique color theme based on its type.
